473,"At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).",1
474,"I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure.",1

494,Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.,1
495,"Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life.",1
496,"But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.",1
497,"If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.",1
498,Awsome Device Works Great!!.,1

574,Plug was the wrong size.,0
575,I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.,1

# Riverus-Assignment-Spandan

# Files:

The assignment_riverus folder contains the taining and testing data.

lr_model.pickle and rf_model.pickle files contain the trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models respectively.

riverus-spandan-assignment.ipynb contains the source code for the assignment.

Prediction.csv contains the predicted data.

Report.pdf contains a brief report about the approach taken to address the given task.

A few image files are also present which contain bar graphs and histograms that were obtained during analysis of the text data.

# Instructions:

The assignment is done in Python 3.

In order to reprouce the results, scikit learn is needed and pickle needs to be up to date.

NLTK library is also needed for the project to run successfully.

Make sure to change the input directory for the training and testing files to be successfully read.

Once all these are done, run the project from the beginning. 

In the Testing section of the notebook, you can uncomment the first few lines of code in the first cell and comment the rest of the code in the same cell. This will load the saved model. (Note: The saved model directory should be mentioned correctly).

Once this is done predictions can be made and the result will be successfully reproduced.
